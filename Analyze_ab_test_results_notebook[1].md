### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).

#### Part I - Probability

To get started, let's import our libraries.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
#We are setting the seed to assure you get the same answers on quizzes as we set up
random.seed(42)
```

`1.` Now, read in the `ab_data.csv` data. Store it in `df`.  **Use your dataframe to answer the questions in Quiz 1 of the classroom.**

a. Read in the dataset and take a look at the top few rows here:


```python
#Read csv
df = pd.read_csv('ab_data.csv')
df.head()
```

</div>



b. Use the cell below to find the number of rows in the dataset.


```python
#Find the number of rows 
df.shape[0]
```




    294478



c. The number of unique users in the dataset.


```python
#Unique user ids
df.user_id.nunique()
```




    290584



d. The proportion of users converted.


```python
#Proportion of users converted
df.converted.mean()
```




    0.11965919355605512



e. The number of times the `new_page` and `treatment` don't match.


```python
#Count the number of lines where new_page and control are aligned, also old page and treatment, and add them up
df.query('landing_page == "new_page" and group == "control"').count()[0] + df.query('landing_page == "old_page" and group == "treatment"').count()[0]
```




    3893



f. Do any of the rows have missing values?


```python
#Search for missing values
df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 294478 entries, 0 to 294477
    Data columns (total 5 columns):
    user_id         294478 non-null int64
    timestamp       294478 non-null object
    group           294478 non-null object
    landing_page    294478 non-null object
    converted       294478 non-null int64

    memory usage: 11.2+ MB


`2.` For the rows where **treatment** does not match with **new_page** or **control** does not match with **old_page**, we cannot be sure if this row truly received the new or old page.  Use **Quiz 2** in the classroom to figure out how we should handle these rows.  

a. Now use the answer to the quiz to create a new dataset that meets the specifications from the quiz.  Store your new dataframe in **df2**.


```python
#Filter on lines where new page and control are aligned
npcontrol = df[(df.landing_page == "new_page") & (df.group == "control")]

#Filter on lines where old page and treatment are aligned
optreatment = df[(df.landing_page == "old_page") & (df.group == "treatment")]

#Concatenate the inaccurate lines 
inaccurate = pd.concat([npcontrol, optreatment])

#Assign the index for these lines
inaccurate_index = inaccurate.index

#Drop the lines with the indexes assigned above
df2 = df.drop(inaccurate_index)
```


```python
# Double Check all of the correct rows were removed - this should be 0
df2[((df2['group'] == 'treatment') == (df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page')) == False].shape[0]
```




    0




```python
#Check the new data frame
df2.head()

`4.` Use **df2** in the cells below to answer the quiz questions related to **Quiz 4** in the classroom.

a. What is the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive?


```python
#Since 1 is considered True, we don't need to specify the condition "converted == 1". 
df2['converted'].mean()
```




    0.11959708724499628



b. Given that an individual was in the `control` group, what is the probability they converted?


```python
#Probability of a user converted in control group
df2[df2['group'] == "control"]['converted'].mean()
```




    0.1203863045004612



c. Given that an individual was in the `treatment` group, what is the probability they converted?


```python
#Probability of a user converted in treatment group
df2[df2['group'] == "treatment"]['converted'].mean()
```




    0.11880806551510564



d. What is the probability that an individual received the new page?


```python
#Probability of a user landing on new_page
(df2.landing_page == "new_page").mean()
```




    0.50006194422266881



e. Consider your results from parts (a) through (d) above, and explain below whether you think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new treatment page leads to more conversions.

**According to above proportions, there is a small difference between users converted from treatment group and from control group, therefore we cannot conclude that the new treatment page leads to more conversions.**

<a id='ab_test'></a>
### Part II - A/B Test

Notice that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed.  

However, then the hard question is do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time?  How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?  

These questions are the difficult parts associated with A/B tests in general.  


`1.` For now, consider you need to make the decision just based on all the data provided.  If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, what should your null and alternative hypotheses be?  You can state your hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.

H_0: Pnew - Pold <=0

H_1: Pnew - Pold >0

`2.` Assume under the null hypothesis, $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ both have "true" success rates equal to the **converted** success rate regardless of page - that is $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal. Furthermore, assume they are equal to the **converted** rate in **ab_data.csv** regardless of the page. <br><br>

Use a sample size for each page equal to the ones in **ab_data.csv**.  <br><br>

Perform the sampling distribution for the difference in **converted** between the two pages over 10,000 iterations of calculating an estimate from the null.  <br><br>

Use the cells below to provide the necessary parts of this simulation.  If this doesn't make complete sense right now, don't worry - you are going to work through the problems below to complete this problem.  You can use **Quiz 5** in the classroom to make sure you are on the right track.<br><br>

a. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{new}$ under the null? 


```python
#Find the proportion of converted rate assuming p_new and p_old are equal
p_new = df2['converted'].mean()
p_new
```




    0.11959708724499628



b. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{old}$ under the null? <br><br>


```python
#Find the proportion of converted rate assuming p_new and p_old are equal
p_old = df2['converted'].mean()
p_old
```




    0.11959708724499628



c. What is $n_{new}$, the number of individuals in the treatment group?


```python
#Number of users landing on new page
n_new = df2.query('group == "treatment"')['user_id'].count()
n_new = int(n_new)
n_new
```




    145310



d. What is $n_{old}$, the number of individuals in the control group?


```python
#Number of users landing on old page
n_old = df2.query('group == "control"')['user_id'].count()
n_old = int(n_old)
n_old
```




    145274



e. Simulate $n_{new}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{new}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{new}$ 1's and 0's in **new_page_converted**.


```python
#Draw samples from a binomial distribution
new_page_converted = np.random.binomial(1, p_new, n_new)
```

f. Simulate $n_{old}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{old}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{old}$ 1's and 0's in **old_page_converted**.


```python
#Draw samples from a binomial distribution
old_page_converted = np.random.binomial(1, p_old,n_old)
```

g. Find $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ for your simulated values from part (e) and (f).


```python
#Number of rows from new page are higher than the ones on old page, therefore we truncate new page up to the numbers of old 
#page and compute the difference
new_page_converted = new_page_converted[:145274]
new_page_converted.mean() - old_page_converted.mean()
```




    0.00086044302490466407



h. Create 10,000 $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ values using the same simulation process you used in parts (a) through (g) above. Store all 10,000 values in a NumPy array called **p_diffs**.


```python
#Simulate 10000 samples of the differences in conversion rates
p_diffs = []

for _ in range(10000):
    new_page_converted = np.random.binomial(1, p_new, n_new)
    old_page_converted = np.random.binomial(1, p_old, n_old)
    new_page_p = new_page_converted.mean()
    old_page_p = old_page_converted.mean()
    p_diffs.append(new_page_p - old_page_p)
```

i. Plot a histogram of the **p_diffs**.  Does this plot look like what you expected?  Use the matching problem in the classroom to assure you fully understand what was computed here.


```python
#Show the histogram
plt.hist(p_diffs);
```


![png](output_59_0.png)


j. What proportion of the **p_diffs** are greater than the actual difference observed in **ab_data.csv**?


```python
#Actual difference of converted rates
actual_diff = (df2[df2['group'] == "treatment"]['converted'].mean()) - (df2[df2['group'] == "control"]['converted'].mean())
actual_diff
```




    -0.0015782389853555567




```python
#Convert to numpy array and calculate the p-value
p_diffs = np.array(p_diffs)
(p_diffs > actual_diff).mean()
```




    0.90739999999999998



k. Please explain using the vocabulary you've learned in this course what you just computed in part **j.**  What is this value called in scientific studies?  What does this value mean in terms of whether or not there is a difference between the new and old pages?

**Actual difference represents the difference between converted rates of new page and old page, based on our data.**

**p-diffs represents the simuated difference between converted rates of new page and old page, based on 10000 simulated samples.**

**Based on the computed p value the new page doesn't have better conversion rates than the old page because the value 0.9 is much higher than the alpha, 0.05. So you fail to reject the null hypothesis**

**The percentage of 90.6 is called scientifically p-value, which determines the probability of obtaining our observed statistic (or one more extreme in favor of the alternative) if the null hypothesis is true.**

l. We could also use a built-in to achieve similar results.  Though using the built-in might be easier to code, the above portions are a walkthrough of the ideas that are critical to correctly thinking about statistical significance. Fill in the below to calculate the number of conversions for each page, as well as the number of individuals who received each page. Let `n_old` and `n_new` refer the the number of rows associated with the old page and new pages, respectively.


```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

#Number of conversions for each page
convert_old = sum(df2.query('group == "control"')['converted'])
convert_new = sum(df2.query('group == "treatment"')['converted'])

#Number of individuals who received each page
n_old = df2.query("group == 'control'")['user_id'].count()
n_new = df2.query("group == 'treatment'")['user_id'].count()

#Convert figures to integers
n_old = int(n_old)
n_new = int(n_new)
```

m. Now use `stats.proportions_ztest` to compute your test statistic and p-value.  [Here](http://knowledgetack.com/python/statsmodels/proportions_ztest/) is a helpful link on using the built in.


```python
#Two-sample Proportion Hypothesis Testing
z_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_new, convert_old], [n_new, n_old], alternative='larger')
z_score
```




    -1.3109241984234394




```python
p_value
```




    0.90505831275902449



n. What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?  Do they agree with the findings in parts **j.** and **k.**?

**A negative z-score suggests and the value of p-value suggests that we should fail to reject the null hypothesis.**

<a id='regression'></a>
### Part III - A regression approach

`1.` In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.<br><br> 

a. Since each row is either a conversion or no conversion, what type of regression should you be performing in this case?

**Logistic regression**

b. The goal is to use **statsmodels** to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives. However, you first need to create in df2 a column for the intercept, and create a dummy variable column for which page each user received.  Add an **intercept** column, as well as an **ab_page** column, which is 1 when an individual receives the **treatment** and 0 if **control**.


```python
#Create intercept column
df2['intercept']=1

#Create dummies
ab_page = ['treatment', 'control']
df2['ab_page'] = pd.get_dummies(df2.group)['treatment']
```

c. Use **statsmodels** to instantiate your regression model on the two columns you created in part b., then fit the model using the two columns you created in part **b.** to predict whether or not an individual converts. 


```python
logit = sm.Logit(df2['converted'], df2[['intercept','ab_page']])
```

d. Provide the summary of your model below, and use it as necessary to answer the following questions.


```python
results = logit.fit()
results.summary()
```

e. What is the p-value associated with **ab_page**? Why does it differ from the value you found in **Part II**?<br><br>  **Hint**: What are the null and alternative hypotheses associated with your regression model, and how do they compare to the null and alternative hypotheses in **Part II**?

**The p-value associated with ab_page column is 0.19 which is lower than the p-value calculated using the z-score function. The reason why is different is due to the intercept added.**

**The p-value (0.190) here remains above an $\alpha$ level of 0.05 but is different because this is a two tailed test. We will still reject the null in this situation.**

**The logistic regression determines only two possible outcomes. If the new page is equal to the old page or different.**

*H0: Pnew-Pold=0*

*H1: Pnew-Pold!=0*

f. Now, you are considering other things that might influence whether or not an individual converts.  Discuss why it is a good idea to consider other factors to add into your regression model.  Are there any disadvantages to adding additional terms into your regression model?

**We could consider introducing the timestamp metric to determine in which part of the day the individuals converted the most. For example, if we find that the evening is the period that users spend most of their time on the internet we might also take it into consideration.**

g. Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. You will need to read in the **countries.csv** dataset and merge together your datasets on the appropriate rows.  [Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) are the docs for joining tables. 

Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  Don't forget to create dummy variables for these country columns - **Hint: You will need two columns for the three dummy variables.** Provide the statistical output as well as a written response to answer this question.


```python
countries_df = pd.read_csv('./countries.csv')
df_new = countries_df.set_index('user_id').join(df2.set_index('user_id'), how='inner')
```


```python
### Create the necessary dummy variables
df_new[['CA','US']] = pd.get_dummies(df_new['country'])[['CA','US']]
df_new.head()
```

h. Though you have now looked at the individual factors of country and page on conversion, we would now like to look at an interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion.  Create the necessary additional columns, and fit the new model.  

Provide the summary results, and your conclusions based on the results.


```python
### Fit Your Linear Model And Obtain the Results
df_new['intercept'] = 1
log_mod = sm.Logit(df_new['converted'], df_new[['CA', 'US', 'intercept', 'ab_page']])
results = log_mod.fit()
results.summary()
```

**Conclusions**

According to the analysis performed I found that the old page was better than the new page, Therefore, we will fail to reject the null and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that there is an interaction between country and page received that will predict whether a user converts or not. Moreover, the histogram shows that the new page is not better than the old page.

From the regression above we see that the p-value is higher in US than in Canada, which means that users in the US are more likely to convert, but still not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
